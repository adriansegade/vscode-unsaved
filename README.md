#YOU HAVE UNSAVED FILES

I think Visual Studio Code does make it clear enough when you have usaved
files.

This extension changes the status bar color when you have unsaved files to
something you can actually notice.

### Caveat

This extension edits the `colorCustomizations` option fields `statusBar.background`
`statusBar.noFolderBackground` and `statusBar.debuggingBackground` so beaware
that those will reset if you have customized them

# YOU HAVE UNSAVED FILES

I think Visual Studio Code does make it clear enough when you have usaved
files. This extension tries to make it more clear!

### Caveat

This extension edits the `colorCustomizations` option fields `statusBar.background`
`statusBar.noFolderBackground` and `statusBar.debuggingBackground` so beaware
that those will reset if you have customized them.
